## Objective

- Define what a Singly Linked List is
- Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays
- Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List?

- A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property
- Linked Lists consists of nodes, and each **node** has a value and a **pointer** to another node or null
- Analogy: A skyscraper with no elevators, but only stairs

## Comparisons with Arrays

### Lists:

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

### Arrays:

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
